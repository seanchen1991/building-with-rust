# Building with Rust: Tim McNamara on *Rust in Action*

Sean: Hello and welcome to *Building with Rust*, a podcast where we talk with people building cool things with the Rust programming language. I’m your host, Sean Chen, and today I’m joined by Tim McNamara, the author of the amazing book *Rust in Action*.

Before we get started with the conversation, Tim and his publisher have graciously provided all listeners of the show with a 35% discount on *Rust in Action*. Simply head over to manning.com and enter the promo code `podbldrust21` at checkout. Thanks again to Tim and Manning for this gracious offer! 

Anyways, without further ado, let’s go ahead and get started! Tim, take it away!

Tim: Sean! Wonderful, ok thanks Sean. My name is Tim McNamara, I am the author of an upcoming book called *Rust in Action*, and I’ve really enjoyed building things with Rust, so I thought it would be fun to hang out.

Sean: Great to finally meet you, digitally of course. I believe you’re in New Zealand? 

Tim: That’s correct. Yea, it’s been very surreal actually, the last 12 months, watching the whole world kind of implode and confine itself. We just locked our borders. Actually, we did a little bit more than that. We had a very serious lockdown and were able to eliminate the virus completely. But now, the downside is that we kind of destroyed our three leading export industries: tourism, international education (so all of the international students can’t come anymore), and there’s one other also. 

So, I know that people laugh at New Zealand and say “Oh, you’re an island, la la la. It’s easy for you guys.” But actually, I think a lot of context needs to be added to that discussion. Remembering actually that New Zealand, as an open economy, is very export-led. It relies very heavily on its tourism industry. 

So, yea that was a long way of saying “Yes, I am from New Zealand!”

Sean: Nice. I honestly only hear nothing but good things about New Zealand. I see videos online. There’s like this one YouTube channel about some guy who just like tours tiny houses. 95% of them are all in New Zealand! And so I see like, the landscape. It’s like, “Wow! So many people there build tiny houses and just live in them.” I love that. I don’t know if I’ll ever personally be able to live in a tiny house with my family, but I love the idea. 

So I’ve only heard nothing but good things about New Zealand, and it looks amazing, from everything that I’ve seen.

Tim: It is actually quite a special place. So I’ve spent a bunch of time in Europe; less time in the states and North America. Nearly a year and a half in Europe over the course of my life. New Zealand is quite special. In terms of the tiny house thing it’s interesting to note that (I was just doing the calculation), the house that I raised my two girls in (who you probably hear in the background) is 80 square meters, which comes out at 861 square feet. So that’s its floor plate. Actually, its floor plate is smaller, it’s a multi-story house as well, so it’s a little tiny thing. 

That isn’t universal, by the way. New Zealand still has people that are environmentally unconscious or, even to some extent, environmentally destructive. It’s not perfect here. We have a big problem with our waterways. We actually export a lot of milk and butter. It’s far less sexy than other industries, but, we have cows dirtying up our waterways, to the extent that which they’re no longer classified as being safe to swim in, which is a big problem culturally for us. 

But yea, New Zealand is a very special place. It does feel...like it’s very far away sometimes.

Sean: Even when you’re in it?

Tim: Yea. Well, only now that I can’t go anywhere else does it feel especially far away. I don’t do that many international trips. When I worked at my last job, actually, it was different; I had multiple trips to Europe every year. But now that I’m not allowed, it’s far away. I was thinking from the technology industry’s point of view and remote working, I dislike the fact that the timezone difference is actually in some sense a bigger thing to bridge. Like if I was to get a job  or do some contracting for a company probably on the west coast, I could probably manage it.

So there’s not a great deal of overlap on the working hours. From that point of view, it would be nice if things were different, but, you know, there’s no perfect place in the world, right? 

So yes, New Zealand is pretty special. But, as someone who is a local, you definitely can see all sides of it, right? Whereas I think if you’re the tourist, or if you’re being sold to, every destination looks wonderful in the brochures. Like, we get ads to kind of go everywhere else, and it’s actually very easy to forget that New Zealand is itself actually quite beautiful. And actually it’s nice to be somewhere where there’s no problem with smog. But it’s still just living, because we still have issues where people get in traffic jams. Y’know, people are still people, they still swear at each other in the street cause they spend too long at the traffic light or something. Ultimately we’re not a special breed of people, even if they filmed *Lord of the Rings* here. 

Sean: Last question about New Zealand: whenever I travel, I always travel to eat. So, if I were to travel to New Zealand, what are the things in New Zealand that you would recommend that I had to eat?

Tim: See, I’m a bad person to ask about this, Sean, for a slightly obscure reason. I live a plant-based life, and so, most people will say “Ah, you’ve just totally restricted yourself to 98% of the good things.” And from New Zealand’s point of view, that’s kind of doubly true.

So, you would immediately go for seafood. The other one is, actually, one of the things that we’re really known for in the cuisine circles is the quality of our lamb. So that would be an interesting thing to try. 

Again, it’s very strange as someone who doesn’t eat animals to advocate for eating animals. But actually one of the things I’ve noticed as I’ve grown up, especially in the last five to ten years is, we’ve had a real influx of especially Asian culture into local cuisine. So there actually are some really amazing places to eat with a huge diversity of what you can eat. It’s almost as if you took an international city and kind of smooshed it into a couple of blocks.

So where I’m from, a town called Wellington, we have roughly half a million people. There are four or five streets, all within walking distance with hundreds and hundreds of cafes and bars and restaurants. 

Sean: That sounds amazing.

Tim: Cafe culture is really strong here, so— 
Actually, that’s a good point, you wouldn’t come to Wellington for food, strictly, but you would definitely come for coffee.

Sean: Haha, ok.

Tim: If you’re a coffee drinker, you’ve never tasted better. Just the quality of the roasting, there are so many local roasteries around here. The quality of the water is really good, the quality of the milk is really good. You might have just triggered something there; I’m quite the coffee person. It’s so disappointing going to other places! Their coffee sucks! Like, this is just warm coffee-flavored water-ish thing. 

So the other thing that has affected what I can eat is, about nine months ago, I became allergic to dairy products. And so I actually can’t consume milk, which for me is a real problem, because I love cheese and I love milk. Yea, so, thinking of something else that New Zealand would do really well, at world standard, would be its cheeses and its wine.

Actually, can we throw that question back to you: what do you like to eat?

Sean: Sure, we’ll totally go on this tangent, why not? 

Tim: You could have a spinoff: *Building with Rust: Cookery*. It could be like *Crafting with Rust*, cooking with Rustaceans. 

Sean: Oh man, that’d be funny. What do I like to eat? I mean, I absolutely will try anything once.

Tim: I hear you.

Sean: I think that’s pretty much the only limitation. I don’t know if I’ll necessarily like it, there are things I don’t like.

Tim: Ok.

Sean: But, I think there’s very few restrictions on that.

Tim: Here’s a question for you, more out of curiosity, and I’m probably not the person who should be asking the questions, but, again, like, what about horse? 

In Korea, you could go for dog meat and other animals. Is there  and end bound for you? 

Sean: I would try it.

Tim: You could try it. Yea, when I used to eat meat, one of the things that was really yummy, actually, is kangaroo meat. 

Sean: Ok. 

Tim: Kangaroos are— there’s so many of them, and they’re so environmentally destructive that you can definitely eat kangaroos and crocodiles over here. 

We should probably move back to Rust potentially. I mean, I’m perfectly happy—

Sean: I was just gonna say—

Tim: Or maybe we don’t—

Sean: I was just gonna say, I feel like I’m showing you how bad of a podcast host I am right now. I probably should have lassoed us back to “relevant territory” a lot sooner than this. But, y’know, whatever, I enjoyed it, so whatever. 

Tim: Yea, right! You can always have two versions of the episode.

Sean: Yea, the director’s cut.

Tim: Yea, you could have the extended edition, right?

Sean: Extended edition, yea. A whole extra hour, just like *Lord of the Rings* for each movie.

Let’s talk about the book. That’s mostly what we’re here to talk about. I think.

Tim: Yea, let’s talk about the book. So what is *Rust in Action* I think is a good place to start.

Sean: Sure.

Tim: Because this was a question I had to grapple with a lot when I was first approached for writing a Rust book. I did not want to do like a “me too” book. That is, I didn’t want to just duplicate something that had already been written. I didn’t want to charge money for something that people would be able to access for free by the web. 

*The Rust Programming Language*, Steve and Carol have done a really wonderful job, and they’ve invested a lot of effort and energy in that. I needed something unique, I needed something that was going to really be compelling. 

And so, what I thought to myself was hey, I see a lot of beginners or people who are curious about Rust who have only done JavaScript, only done Python, or have only done some, like maybe Java or C#. They come to this language because they want to understand low-level programming, but it’s scary. They’ve always been told that pointers are dangerous, that manipulating memory is going to cause problems, and that they’re not good enough. That humans are not good enough at building these systems securely.

And so I said to myself, I’m going to write a book that teaches people systems programming *and* Rust at the same time. And that is going to be enough to get people to give them the confidence to learn the language. That you don’t just learn the surface-level features, you actually understand a lot of the philosophy of Rust by working your way through *Rust in Action*.

Sean: Mhm. I think I bought a pretty early version, like really really early. I was just curious. I was at some point where I was buying up Rust books left and right. Steve and Carol’s book is amazing, but I obviously also wanted other perspectives. What’s the other one called? *Programming Rust*, I got that one, I got yours. I forget other ones I bought, I bought a bunch as well. 

I remember thinking, when I was reading through that early draft that yours was just like, I thought the book was, is, very ambitious in kind of how much ground you opt to cover. Is that a feature or a bug?

Tim: Mmm. Yea, ok, right. Probably a bug, right?

Sean: Haha, ok.

Tim: Realistically, like, from the reader’s point of view, definitely a feature, because they get to pick and choose. The chapters are not strictly chronological or interdependent. You could kind of jump around to what interests you. They’re all project-based. 

But it meant it was extremely difficult to engineer the book, right? I’ve got a chapter on timekeeping, and as part of that I was like “Huh, wouldn’t it be fun if we implemented NTP?” Because I think everyone just kind of installs this thing and let it go. But what’s happening there? 

So, we implement NTP, or an NTP client, and that involves understanding UDP, because UDP is the protocol that’s used. And the complexity starts to unravel from there. Cause now I’ve got UDP that I’ve got to explain, and this and this and other things. And that’s why the scope problem was a problem, or was a bug, because I had to research these different areas, then I had to write an implementation of the idea that I wanted to do, which took weeks for both of those steps.

And then I would often have to wittle down the examples to only introduce a little bit of extra Rust in every example. At the start of the book we know no Rust. Well, realistically, people coming to the book, turning to *Rust in Action*, will have read other bits and pieces. But for the benefit of the occasional person that doesn’t, it starts with nothing, and then in every chapter we kind of grow our Rust language that we can use.

So we get to the timekeeping chapter and we’re about two-thirds of the way through, and so I kind of had to cut out bits and pieces of every example to make it fit, because you don’t want to overload or overwhelm a reader with having to learn three concepts at the same time.

And so, people have rightly been a little concerned about the book’s development in terms of how long it has taken. I was definitely warned about this and I decided to naively do it anyway. Because part of the reason why I did this, and took on such a big job, was that I had this idea in my head when I started that the quality of technical materials has kind of been slipping over the last couple of years. A lot of other material is kind of just like content marketing. Y’know, like, a product will come out and they’ll write a book that surrounds it which is just basically the technical documentation with a little bit of embellishment. 

And I really wanted something that was very very good, that will live on someone’s bookshelf for ten years. And ultimately I wanted, and this is going to sound ridiculous, but I have always had in my mind this idea that buying *Rust in Action* will save you 100 hours of your Rust learning journey. That to me has always been the goal.

And so I was willing to accept taking another, say, 6 weeks on getting a chapter right, because I knew that, let’s say, 10_000 readers, would benefit from that. If I saved them an extra two hours of their life, that’s 20_000 hours right there.

And so, it was worth spending extra effort, and in fact, the response in terms of reviews and feedback has rewarded the choice of trying to spend more effort to get from an A book to say an A+ book has really— there was definitely diminishing returns but I decided to walk that path anyway, and I’m really glad with the result that I’ve achieved.

I also know this text will stand the test of time. It is in some sense both specific because it’s building examples but also generic and also universally applicable because we talk about the fundamentals of computing systems like how virtual memory operates, what is a CPU is actually doing. Like, how do we know what a CPU actually does? Well, we implement a CPU, right?

Going back to one of the earlier points I made: *Rust in Action*’s audience originally was just me. You should have just seen my face, and the excitement just stayed with me for days when I got my CPU emulator running. Like, I was just buzzing at this idea that I could just send in binary instructions into a memory array, and then those would be executed, and it would print out a new answer for me. I was just over the moon about the fact that this was humanly possible, and that I was the human that did it!

I feel that I came into Rust as “just a Python programmer”; heaps of text mining and machine learning, but no serious programming. And never any C++. At that point, I really felt like I had made it. 

Sean: This is a great next question. You said that you felt like you made it. In the course of writing this book now, feel like you’re a Rust expert, do you get treated like that in the community?

Tim: I don’t know if you’ve followed the history. But the development of *Rust in Action* has really been quite painful for me, personally. So I’ve probably sunk about two and a half thousand hours into the development of the book over the last four and a half years. Part of the struggle, mentally, was just this inescapable impostor syndrome. Every single time that I pushed an update, I told my editor “Ok, I’ve got a draft for a new chapter”, I spent days and days and days worrying about a flood of emails telling me how wrong I was. 

Like, “Why are you spreading this disinformation through our industry?” 

“I spent money for this?” 

I just expected this kind of flood of real negativity. And, it never came! The cool thing about the Rust community is that actually they’re really nice good people! I had all these people that I just kind of adore come out and say “Actually, this is really really good stuff”!

Florian Glitcher, for example, over in Germany, he’s saying like *Rust in Action* might be the best book in 2021! And I’m just like “How is this possible?”

So in terms of the wider question of like “Am I a Rust expert?” Claiming that trophy does not come naturally to me. There are better Rust programmers in the world. I know that for a fact. That is accurate to say, that there are better Rust programmers than me. But, if anyone is going to be an expert, it’s someone who knows enough and is also able to communicate and teach. 

If I were to kind of step back from myself and evaluate myself  against those three criteria: a) Do I have a sufficient bank of knowledge? And am I also able to communicate that and teach? Well then, yes, I qualify as an expert in Rust.

A challenging thing for me, personally, is becoming more and more prominent and receiving lots and lots of requests for assistance. I mean, I often bring that on myself, like, if I’ve got some free time, I’ll solicit questions and say “Hey look, whose got some help?”

I’ve got a calendly thing where people can book 15 minute slots with me, and I’ve extended that publicly. So a lot of that is self-inflicted. But, it’s a very strange feeling when, for example, I went to a local industry event, and someone was like “Oh, oh wow, you’re Tim McNamara. You’re like, New Zealand’s Rust guy, right?”

Like, what? How is this a thing?

I kind of flirt with these aspirations of becoming kind of one of these weird tech celebrities, and then I kind of pull myself back and saying, actually, no, you’re way too far away. The local industry isn’t big enough to support that kind of thing. Like there are probably three or four companies with Rust in production here.

Anyways, sorry,there was actually a thing I was going for when I was starting that sentence. I wanted to say that I have been absolutely delighted by the response that the Rust community has provided for me, and how welcoming they have been. I honestly didn’t expect it.

But also, I should also point out that I still ask for help for questions about Rust. Like, I am not one of these people that aims for perfection. And I don’t want to present an illusion that I’m some kind of perfect developer, because I’m just a person.

Yea, I think that’s really important from the perspective of creating a community. I’ve really latched on to Rust’s empowerment message. I think that’s extremely important, and Rust isn’t a community that I think needs a lot of grandstanding. I want to make sure that people who are curious and a little bit confused can feel safe when they ask for help. And I think the way that I can demonstrate that as a leader in the community is by asking for help myself.

So for example, I was like, one of the things I keep forgetting  is that small integer types can’t act as indices. Like, I just want my little u32 to be an index to like a slice. Why can’t I do that? Like, why do I have to cast it as usize? It doesn’t make sense!

So I kind of went down this little rabbit hole of looking it up. Y’know, there are various around backwards compatibility, but, yea, I don’t want to create an impression that I’m a perfect Rust developer.

And I also think that if I become more and more notable, or famous even, in the Rust community, it will be because I’m a positive contributor to the overall ecosystem and not because I’m trying to take someone’s place. 

Sean: We were talking a little about this before we started recording, but like, what’s your kind of involvement in the Rust community itself besides the book? Are you involved in working groups, in teams, etc.?

Tim: Right, so I have been very sheepish about the fact that I haven’t been kind of “participating enough”. One of the things that I feel this kind of mental of— someone who’s supposed to be participating. I feel this weight of responsibility, I don’t know if it exists or not.

To answer your question, I am not a current member of any of the working groups and haven’t participated in the core to a large extent. I have participated as part of libs team, a couple of meetings. But I’ve pulled away to focus on delivery of the book, basically. And now my eyes are opening and I’m wondering, do I— I’m trying to think about next steps. 

Yea, two things. I think I contribute to the Rust community by growing the community.

Sean: That’s important!

Tim: I would like to participate in the Rust language, but honestly, and this may sound silly, the project is really big! And I don’t quite know— like, there are dozens of working groups. Is it Zulip? Is it Discord? Is it internals@rust-lang.org? It’s everywhere!

I don’t want to deal with like six different communications channels. I don’t know how to engage really. And I think that’s probably kind of silly, because I could figure it out, but also, I’m not sure.

Sean: No, I totally relate to that. The whole needing to download Zulip, you have to download Discord, you have to look at the Rust internals forums. It is kind of ridiculous how fractured all the different segments of the Rust project. Yea, that’s totally true, because I had way fewer communications channels before getting deeper into Rust. It seems to be a problem that nobody really acknowledges.

But no, I totally agree, I totally agree. I wish there could just be one central— like, you want to contribute to Rust, you want to talk to other Rust people, you just go here, and that’s it, period.

Tim: Yea, well, I remember being like “What the heck?” when I first saw people being sent to Discord. It turns out a thousand people are in there. 

And I was like “Oh wow, so this is where the community is at.” 

And then I got told off because I was in the wrong Discord server— well, not quite told off, people were nice. 

From my understanding, every working group has the flexibility to choose its own tools, but, well, they definitely have!

The other thing around contributing to Rust, and again, this is more of a me problem than a Rust problem probably, is that there are so many good Rust people already!

Sean: Yea.

Tim: I just look at the output. To be able to participate, I just read through these discussions on the issues on PRs and RFPs. There are dozens of comments that are really thoughtful, and I’m like wow, there is so much context that I need to retain in order to participate in a meaningful way. There’s a lot of learning, and then if I did that learning, I don’t know if I would even be at the level of some of these people!

I mean, I’m sure if you were inside the project, you’re like “it’s not like that”. But I’m at the stage where I’m just like totally overwhelmed. Like I’m just looking through the rust-lang GitHub now and there’s 400– sorry, 342 open PRs and they’ve closed over 44,000. And there are six and a half thousand open issues, like, how many of those issues do I need to read through to participate in any of these PRs?

How much of the history— I don’t know. I’m both demonstrating the problem of the fact that impostor syndrome is quite real by feeling totally intimidated by this project, but also, I want to definitely— I also want people to feel like they have a place at the table.

The open source and free software communities have been pretty poisonous in places recently, and so— well, not recently, over their whole history. And I think Rust is a safe space, and the Rust leadership have actually worked really really hard to ensuring that it’s a safe space.

One comment around the fact that the community is fractured, like it’s all over Discord servers and Discourse forum, plural, and Zulip and so forth, is that there’s a layer of commonality with the code of conduct and the community expectations.

And that has kind of fed into other spaces as well which are kind of Rust adjacent. So I’ve got my own Discord server. That too actually has a code of conduct which is basically verbatim taken from the Rust code of conduct with just some of the Rust wording kind of elided because it’s slightly more general.

The Rust ecosystem has been able to demonstrate that an open source community is able to be welcoming and positive, and like, a human’s first project not just a code-first enterprise.

Sean: Yea, that’s something I hold so dearly about the Rust community and what I think makes it special. Yea, obviously there’s a lot of space for these really cool technical challenges and problems, but I think at the end of the day, it’s clear that what Rust cares most about— what the community cares most about are the other community members and the well-being of the community itself, I suppose.

What you were saying with you starting your own Discord, I think that’s as close of as answer as I’ve kind of come up with as far as battling that feeling of feeling overwhelmed to try to contribute to Rust in the first place. Because I agree, it’s so vast and there’s just so much there, and there’s so much context, and just even understanding and keeping up with it I think feels like it would be its own full time job.

So I think, just kind of picking a little corner, finding a niche of the Rust community and just settling in there is, you know, probably the best thing you can do.

Tim: Right. And I think the Rust community is really big now, right? Like, it continues to grow very very aggressively, in like quite a positive way, I don’t mean aggressive in that kind of “grr” aggressive, I just mean its rate of growth continues to— and I’m doing a bit of tracking on the Rust subreddit, because one of the places where I’m quite active is that subreddit; it doubles every nine months, and it has been since its inception. 

That means, two things, one is, you’re absolutely right, it’s possible to find little corners of the Rust community where you can find a gaggle or bubble of friends within that wider space. 

But also, it means that every nine months— it means that in order to be in the top 50% of Rust programming language developers by experience, you just need to wait for nine months!

Sean: That’s a good point.

Tim: There’s always going to be at least half people in the Rust community with less than a year of Rust experience. I mean I worry about this from a philosophical level. 

Like how is it going to be possible to maintain kind of like really positive norms with exponential growth of the membership? Because eventually, newcomers are going to not have all the context, right? Like, there’s a lot!

Sean: Yea.

Tim: I feel like people that have decided to— Y’know like I was one these people back in, say 2015 or 2014 even, I was like “Is it going to Rust or is it going to Go? Is it going to be Mozilla that wins or is it going to Google that wins?” 

Was anyone else like that or was that just me? I don’t know. Anyway, I was totally like “I bet it’s going to be Google that wins but I really want it to be Mozilla that wins.” Like that was kind of my approach.

I kind of encountered Go as a professional developer, and it turns out, after working with Rust, Rust is just so much— like, the compiler is just so much more helpful!

Why do we accept programming languages that aren’t as good as Rust? Why are error messages not helpful? You call yourself a statically-typed programming language, but your types are all kind of weird and dynamic, and so—

Sorry, I don’t want to rabbit on about Go. I actually find Go really pleasant to use. But, you’ve still got things that shouldn’t be there. Like, there are still no pointer dereferences. Like, it still sucks!

And like, I know that Rust sucks; everything sucks! But also, I just feel like there are bits and pieces of software engineering that should not be a problem anymore. Like, literally they were fixed decades ago, and Rust has just kind of pulled them all together in one cohesive system. Yea.

Sean: Nice. I feel like I could talk to you about this for a lot longer. So I think we’re gonna have to probably cut this off around here. But that was really fun to listen to. 

And it’s funny because I don’t think I did my job as host that well, if I’m being totally honest. But, you know, whatever. I do this just as much for me as for anybody else.

Tim: No no no, I don’t think you should apologize. Yea, and again, like for me, it was mostly— this is gonna sound silly, but catching up was mostly around— like for me it’s like this opportunity to meet this guy Sean Chen. 

I mean, I’ve been reading your blog posts and stuff, and I’m like “This is good stuff!”

Like I actually was quite curious about learning about your LRU cache!

Sean: Wow, you read that. Ok. Cool.

Tim: And I’m actually really curious about how you did your diagrams. I know that sounds really silly.

Sean: The diagrams were done in— Google has a diagram one, you just like draw little arrows around with your mouse, and so that was literally it. And then sometimes I will—

Tim: All right, cause I’ve mucked around with InkScape, and gosh, that... sucks. Like, it’s great, I love InkScape, and I’ve gotten really good at it. But, it doesn’t have the convenience factor, I think. 

And I’m sure there’ll be other people who just kind of put this on in the background and they won’t mind that it was kind of weirdly off-topic.

Sean: Yea, that’d be awesome. Cool, we gotta do the obligatory social media plugs, of course. So, where can people find out more about you, what are you active on?

Tim: Ok, well, I would love to hear from anybody at all interested in Rust, because I absolutely have decided to go all in on the language. So, if you would like to chat, easiest way is to search for “timClicks”. Pretty much every social media platform, I’ve been able to retain that nickname. So, the big ones are probably Twitter and Twitch and YouTube— there are more, but those are the main three. 

Sean: Cool! It was absolutely a pleasure Tim. Have a good one, and I’ll talk to later.

Tim: Sweet! Ok, great, thanks Sean!

Sean: That concludes our conversation with Tim. If you like what you heard, please leave us a review on your podcasting platform of choice. If there are topics you’d like to hear us cover or particular folks you’d like to hear us talk to on the show, you can email us at buildingwithrust@gmail.com to relay your feedback and thoughts. 

That’s all for today’s show! 

We’ll leave you with some B-roll audio of Tim talking about the birds of his native New Zealand. Enjoy!
